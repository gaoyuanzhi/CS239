# CS239 Investigate relation between project popularity and documentation updates

The goal of this project is to find if there is a positive correlation between project popularity and the documentation updates. We are not examining the actual quality of the documentation, but how often is is updated. We are also not necessarily looking for causation, but a correlation. There is the possibility that popularity could result in better documentation, or that good up to date documentation leads to popularity. Besides the analysis of correlation between project popularity and the documentation, we also aim to provide a tool that generates the graphical results.
